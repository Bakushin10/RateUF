# RateUF #
This is our senior project at University of Florida Apring 2018

## Motivation ##

RateUF will be used to help UF students determine what courses to take when registering. When trying to find a good course to take, one has to look through multiple pages and ask the people they know if they have taken the course. In our application, you will be able to log on and will be able to search a specific course. You will be able to write a review that summarizes the course and the professor that taught it that semester.
